# CS-3100 #
This repository may or may not provide valid solutions for CS-3100. Do not
reuse code, please. This is meant as an archive for my own code and as a helpful
guide to anyone who might stumble upon it. Do not consider these solutions to be
valid.
## Please ##
My ultimate goal is for this repository to help understand concepts. You are
hurting only yourself if you simply copy-paste code and make no attempts to
understand what is actually happening. Please note that using this code as
anything more than a helpful resource is a violation of academic integrity
policies.

# Need Help? #
I don't anticipate ever receiving any messages on this, so I'll gladly offer to
help anyone who needs a hint or some guidance for this class. Feel free to email
me using the address in my Github profile. I realize that in many places my
commenting is rather poor, so I have no qualms with explaining some concepts,
usages, or anything else involved herein.
