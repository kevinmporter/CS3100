# CS-3100 #
This repo contains all turned-in work for CS-3100. All projects will provide
correct solutions to assignments. Feel free to use this as a guide to help you
through the course. I'd recommend you remove my name and maybe toy around with
formatting, variable names, and so on if you're going to reuse this code (which
   I happily encourage you to do!).
## Please ##
My ultimate goal is for this repository to help understand concepts. You are
hurting only yourself if you simply copy-paste code and make no attempts to
understand what is actually happening. Please note that using this code as
anything more than a helpful resource is a violation of academic integrity
policies.

# Need Help? #
I don't anticipate ever receiving any messages on this, so I'll gladly offer to
help anyone who needs a hint or some guidance for this class. Feel free to email
me using the address in my Github profile. I realize that in many places my
commenting is rather poor, so I have no qualms with explaining some concepts,
usages, or anything else involved herein.
